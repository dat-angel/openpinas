# Dynasty Expansion Plan

## Current Status

**Tracked:** 31 dynasties  
**Reality:** ~250 political families in Philippines  
**Coverage:** 12% of total political dynasties

## The Gap

We're currently tracking only the most high-profile dynasties:
- National power dynasties (Marcos, Duterte, Aquino, etc.)
- Major regional dynasties with national connections
- Dynasties with significant 2025 events or corruption scandals

**Missing:** The vast majority of regional and local dynasties that control provinces and cities.

## Expansion Strategy

### Phase 1: Major Missing Dynasties (Target: 50-60 dynasties)

#### Negros Region (3-5 dynasties)
- **Lacson family** (Negros Occidental) - Multiple governors, mayors
- **Zayco family** (Negros Occidental) - Provincial control
- **Marañon family** (Negros Occidental) - Long-standing dynasty
- **Other Negros families** - Research needed

#### Pangasinan (2-3 dynasties)
- **Espino family** - Multiple terms as governor
- **Cojuangco family** (Pangasinan branch) - Different from Tarlac Cojuangco
- **Other Pangasinan families** - Research needed

#### Bicol Region (5-8 dynasties)
- Multiple provinces (Albay, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, etc.)
- Each province likely has 1-2 major dynasties
- Research: Villafuerte, Andaya, other families

#### Zamboanga (3-5 dynasties)
- Multiple clans across Zamboanga provinces
- Historical political families
- Research needed for current control

#### Metro Manila Cities (5-10 dynasties)
- **Pasig** - Current mayor dynasty
- **Quezon City** - Multiple mayoral dynasties
- **Caloocan** - Political families
- **Valenzuela** - Political families
- **Other Metro Manila cities** - Research needed

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Coverage (Target: 80-100+ dynasties)

- Add city-level dynasties in major cities
- Add emerging/new dynasties (2025-2026)

### Phase 3: Historical & Defunct (Optional)

- Historical dynasties (pre-2025, now defunct but influential)
- Dynasties that lost power in 2025 elections

## Research Methodology

### Sources
1. **PCIJ (Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism)**
   - Dynasty reports and research
   - Election analysis

2. **Election Results**
   - 2025 midterm election results by province
   - Historical election data
   - Identify families with multiple members in office

3. **Local News Sources**

### Data Collection Process

For each dynasty:
1. **Identify the family** - Name, patriarch/matriarch

3. **Current positions** - Who holds what office
4. **Historical span** - When established, peak power
5. **Key members** - Current political figures
6. **Relationships** - Alliances, rivalries, marriages
7. **2025 events** - Any significant events
8. **Corruption connections** - Any allegations or cases

### Validation

- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Verify current positions (2025-2026)
- Check for recent changes (elections, resignations)
- Validate relationships with other dynasties

## Priority Regions

### High Priority (Major gaps)

2. Pangasinan (2-3 dynasties)
3. Bicol (5-8 dynasties)

- **Week 5-6:** Research and add Metro Manila city dynasties (5-10 total)
- **Week 7-8:** Research and add additional Mindanao/Visayas/Luzon (20-30 total)

**Target:** 50-60 dynasties by end of Phase 1 (8 weeks)

## Notes

- Quality over quantity - ensure data accuracy
- Focus on dynasties with current political control (2025-2026)
- Prioritize dynasties with relationships to existing tracked dynasties
- Include dynasties with corruption connections or significant events
- Maintain consistent data structure and format
