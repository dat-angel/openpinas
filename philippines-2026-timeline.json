      "description": "Batangas 1st District Rep. Leandro Antonio Legarda Leviste, founder of Solar Philippines and son of Senator Loren Legarda, claims to possess the 'Cabral Files' - documents allegedly listing 2025 infrastructure allocations and their proponents. The files are linked to the late DPWH Undersecretary Maria Catalina Cabral who was found dead in December 2025 during the flood control investigation. Leviste confirmed requesting a meeting with Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson to discuss the files. Meanwhile, the DOE slapped his Solar Philippines company with a P24 billion penalty for failing to deliver on power contracts (only 2% of 11,000 megawatts committed capacity). Leviste called the fine an attempt to silence him and filed a P110 million libel case against Presidential spokesperson Claire Castro. The 32-year-old neophyte congressman, recognized as the youngest self-made billionaire in the Philippines, has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing corruption exposé.",
